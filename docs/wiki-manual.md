# GitHub Wiki Construction Manual

## Purpose
This manual provides a standardized approach for building comprehensive documentation wikis for software projects.

## Wiki Structure Template

### 1. Home Page (`Home.md`)
- Project technical overview and purpose
- Quick navigation to all sections
- Quick navigation to technical documentation
- Links to key developer resources (repository, CI/CD, package registry)

### 2. Getting Started (`Getting-Started/`)
- `Development-Setup.md` - Setting up the development environment
- `Quick-Start.md` - Get the code running in 5 minutes
- `Architecture-Overview.md` - High-level system design
  <!-- Use Mermaid syntax for visual representation -->
- `Core-Concepts.md` - Essential technical concepts and terminology

### 3. Architecture (`Architecture/`)
- `Technology-Stack.md` - Languages, frameworks, and tools used
- `System-Design.md` - Overall architecture and design patterns
- `Module-Structure.md` - Code organization and dependencies
  <!-- Use Mermaid syntax for visual representation -->
- `Data-Flow.md` - How data moves through the system
  <!-- Use Mermaid syntax for visual representation -->

### 4. Testing (`Testing/`)
<!-- Skip items that don't exist -->
- `Testing-Strategy.md` - Overall testing approach
- `Unit-Testing.md` - Writing and running unit tests
- `Integration-Testing.md` - Integration test guidelines
- `E2E-Testing.md` - End-to-end testing approach
- `Performance-Testing.md` - Load and performance testing

### 5. Development Guides (`Development-Guides/`)
<!-- Skip items that don't exist -->
- `Local-Development.md` - Running locally
- `Debugging.md` - Debugging techniques and tools
- `Profiling.md` - Performance profiling
- `Logging.md` - Logging standards and practices
- `Monitoring.md` - Observability and monitoring
- `Code-Styles.md` - Coding conventions and style guide

### 6. Deployment (`Deployment/`)
<!-- Skip items that don't exist -->
- `Build-Process.md` - How to build the project
- `Configuration.md` - Environment configuration
- `Deployment-Guide.md` - Deployment procedures
- `Infrastructure.md` - Infrastructure requirements
- `CI-CD.md` - Continuous integration and deployment

### 7. Security (`Security/`)
<!-- Skip items that don't exist -->
- `Security-Overview.md` - Security architecture
- `Authentication.md` - Auth implementation
- `Authorization.md` - Access control
- `Security-Best-Practices.md` - Secure coding guidelines

## Rules

- **Formatting**: Use GitHub Flavored Markdown.
  - **Mermaid Syntax**: Use Mermaid syntax for architecture and data flow diagrams.
  - **Links**: Use Markdown link syntax for links to related documents and resources within sections.
    - Example: `[Link Text](full-URL-of-wiki-page)`
- **Consistency**: Each section should use the same format and style.
- **Source Attribution**: Clearly indicate which files in the repository the information was derived from using GitHub Permalinks.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10+

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/aku11i/phantom.git
cd phantom
pnpm install

# run phantom in development mode
pnpm phantom
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint
# or
pnpm fix

# Run all checks before committing
pnpm ready
```

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Language Requirements

- **All files, issues, and pull requests must be written in English**
- This ensures the project is accessible to the global community

### Code Style

- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Keep modules focused and testable

### Architecture Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has one clear responsibility
- **Separation of Concerns**: CLI, business logic, and git operations are separated
- **Testability**: Core modules are framework-agnostic and easily testable
- **No Code Duplication**: Common operations are centralized
- **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies flow from CLI → Core (including Git operations)

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:file src/core/worktree/create.test.js
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for all new features
- Follow existing test patterns
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

## ✨ Code Quality

### Before Committing

Always run the following command before committing:

```bash
pnpm ready
```

This command runs:
- Linting (`pnpm lint`)
- Type checking (`pnpm typecheck`)
- All tests (`pnpm test`)

### Security Best Practices

- Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys
- Never commit secrets or keys to the repository
- Be careful with user input validation

## 🚀 Pull Request Requirements

- Clear description of changes
- Tests for new functionality
- Documentation updates if applicable
- All checks passing (`pnpm ready`)
- Follow existing code style

## 📚 Documentation

When contributing documentation:

- Keep language clear and concise
- Update the table of contents if adding sections
- Check for broken links

## 🚀 Release Process

To release a new version of Phantom:

1. **Bump version**
   ```bash
   # Trigger the automated version bump workflow via GitHub CLI
   # release_type: patch | minor | major | prepatch | preminor | premajor | prerelease
   gh workflow run version-bump.yml -f release_type=patch

   # Example: start a prerelease minor bump
   gh workflow run version-bump.yml -f release_type=preminor

   # Wait for the workflow to finish and create the PR for you
   gh run watch --exit-status --workflow=version-bump.yml
   ```

2. **Review the version bump PR created by the workflow**
   - Confirm version numbers and changelog/doc updates if any
   - Merge the PR once checks pass

3. **Create GitHub release (publishes to npm)**
    ```bash
    # Create a release with automatically generated notes
    gh release create v<version> \
      --title "Phantom v<version>" \
      --generate-notes \
      --target main

    # Example for v1.3.0:
    gh release create v1.3.0 \
      --title "Phantom v1.3.0" \
      --generate-notes \
      --target main
    ```

   Publishing to npm is handled by `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` when the release is published. Releases from `pre*` bumps are published with the `next` dist-tag; all other releases use `latest`. Monitor the workflow run in GitHub Actions to ensure it completes successfully.

4. **Update release notes for clarity**
   - Review the auto-generated release notes using `gh release view v<version>`
   - Check PR descriptions for important details using `gh pr view <number>`
   - Update the release notes to be more user-friendly:
     - Group changes by category (Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements, Documentation)
     - Add usage examples for new features with code blocks
     - Credit external contributors inline (e.g., "Thanks @username!")
     - Include PR numbers for all changes
     - Add installation/upgrade instructions
     - Include "New Contributors" section with PR numbers
   
   ```bash
   # Edit the release notes
   gh release edit v<version> --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
